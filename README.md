This is the server side, a client side exists [RedBadgeServer](https://github.com/BrentonPhoenix/RedBadgeClient)

This project is deployed to heroku along with the server here [HyperSpace-SocialMedia](https://hyperspace-sm.herokuapp.com/). It is under a Hobby Developer Account, so it exists under some restrictions however it should suffice for a demo.

This project is intended to create a social media site that is tailored to people with ADHD. Currently it is a work in progress. 
Needs:
    []- commentController (totally empty at the moment)
    []- will probably refine the models a bit in the future
    []- friends list(many to many connection)
    []- paranoid tables? at least for the comments probably for posts and topics as well, if i implement some sort of private messaging feature THAT needs to be paranoid(policy and abuse reasons). Can you set paranoid tables to dump data after a period of time? Like a year from the date of 'delete'.

---

The current state of the project as a whole has only about 40% of the eventual functionality i desire, and I probably won't open it up to contributions until I have it reach my own personal Definition of Done. That said the server is almost totally complete.

---

Currently the functionality that exists within the server:

1. just functional? i dont actually know how to describe a server's functionality?
2. jwt works
3. postgres connection works
4. fetches mostly work except for get one post?? for?? some reason???
